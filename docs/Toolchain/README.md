# Toolchain

The following tools are developed around REAM language.
The goal is to provide a user-friendly workflow to create, edit, distribute and reuse REAM files.

## Alpha

- [reamparser.js](https://github.com/chmlee/reamparser.js):
a REAM parser written in JavaScript.
This is the current default parser for REAM Editor.

- [REAM Editor](https://chmlee.github.io/ream-editor):
a web-based editor for REAM.

- [REAM Editor Lite](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-editor-lite):
a lite version of REAM Editor as a Vue component.

- [prism-ream](https://github.com/chmlee/prism):
a fork of syntax highlighting library [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) with REAM support added.
Pull requests may be submitted once the language is stable.

- [ream.vim](https://github.com/chmlee/ream.vim):
syntax highlighting for REAM in Vim.

- [ream-core](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-core):
an experimental REAM parser written in Rust.
Planned functionalities include emitter, linter, and documentation generator.
It may replace reamparser.js as the default parser for REAM Editor if the development goes well.




## Planned

- A project and package manager for REAM, inspired by [python-poetry](https://python-poetry.org) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).


## Not maintained
- [ream-python](https://github.com/chmlee/ream-python):
a REAM parser and emitter written in Python and [lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark).
It is still available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ream/) if anyone is interested.
